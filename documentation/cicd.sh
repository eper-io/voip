# Check out Moose Assist
# git clone https://gitlab.com/eper.io/voip.git /tmp/voip
# Run this command from /tmp/voip:

# Short glitch in the service. Acceptable.
(git pull -r | grep 'up to date') || kill -9 `pgrep moosebroker`

# We may want to run a privileged container in the future. It is difficult to mix podman and golang
cd /tmp/voip
go build -o /opt/moosebroker ./eos/main/main.go

# All the worker containers keep running for their respective customers until they shut down themselves. (~2 hours)

# Run test container

docker stop -t 2 moose

# Running docker as root on the network is dangerous so we need to be very lean and careful with the codebase in /eos
