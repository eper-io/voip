      <h1>Documentation</h1>
      Thank you for your consideration.
      <p>This is a cloud service to make studio-quality audio calls.</p>
      <p><strong>Howto</strong><br>You click on the moose to get a line. It redirects you to a line that is only yours. It is a container. www.example.com/line.html?apikey=root_abcd#generate_leaf<br>Click Join, and ðŸ“¤ share the browser url with the peer to join on Slack, email, etc.</p>
      <p><strong>Digitalocean & Other Cloud</strong><br>Look for the connection url in the app logs starting with "Try wired https://voip-2-g9p9u.ondigital...".</p>
      <p><strong>Customers</strong><br>We designed it for professionals, private conversations, and all who quickly need a backup of their regular channel.</p>
      <p><strong>Why?</strong><br>We wanted to create an industry best practice service. It is a simple software stack that anyone can verify, review, and replicate.</p>
      <p><strong>Softphone</strong><br>It is not strictly a softphone service like the ones offered by Salesforce, etc. We try to drive people away from phone numbers to predictable channels.</p>
      <p><strong>Cost</strong><br>Costs vary by cloud services. You pay us, and we pay for the cloud hardware, product quality, and we protect your data.</p>
      <p><strong>Telemetry</strong><br>We collect data that is necessary for reliability not marketing. We do not use cookies. That is our lead.</p>
      <p><strong>Latency</strong><br>The raw audio format has a default bandwidth of 3.2 megabits per second upstream and downstream. The benefits are lower support costs, hardware independence, and lower latency.</p>
      <p><strong>Quality</strong><br>The design principle is sensible quality. We use a sample rate of 200KHz and 16 bits of precision - studio quality. Our 200 kHz sampling rate provides 4x precision gains over the standard 44KHz. 24-bits may give an additional 256x of precision in angles. It is deemed unnecessary.</p>
      <p><strong>Alternatives</strong><br>Our solution allows only one peer to protect your privacy. This is what it is for. You can choose alternatives if you need features like a group chat. You can try Zoomâ„¢, Skypeâ„¢, WeChatâ„¢, or stuff from Facebookâ„¢ or Googleâ„¢.</p>
      <p><strong>WebRTC</strong><br>Why not WebRTC? WebRTC is great if you rely on your hardware and OS codecs, and you need many features. It relies on external dependencies, which may contain vulnerabilities. Our goal is to be the ultimate benchmark backup call to test against.</p>
      <p><strong>Open</strong><br>We posted the codebase to <a href="https://gitlab.com/eper.io/voip">https://gitlab.com/eper.io/voip</a>. Secure it using the up to date best practices of your organization and locale.</p>
      <p><strong>End To End Encryption</strong><br>The first pillar of security is end-to-end encryption. We use 256-bit AES-CTR. The silent channel is unencoded, ensuring that the initialization and natural audio vectors are unique together.</p>
      <p><strong>Persistent Threats</strong><br>Be wary of end-to-end encryption. The reason is that it only deters casual attackers. Targeted attackers would steal the private keys from the endpoints. Malware and in-room cameras are as dangerous as an unencrypted channel.</p>
      <p><strong>Target Audience</strong><br>We designed our service for professional and personal use. Criminal activity is not tolerated.</p>
      <p><strong>Security By Isolation</strong><br>The second pillar of security is an isolated virtual server for the lifetime of the connection. If you need simple end-to-end encryption using a password and the TLS closure of your PaaS provider, you may want to opt for Zoomâ„¢, Hangoutsâ„ , etc.</p>
      <p><strong>Standard Security</strong><br>We also use the latest TLS and API keys called root to ensure that you paid for the container. End-to-end encrypted leaf keys are url hashtags, that never leave the browsers.</p>
      <p><strong>Tabs</strong><br>Private and incognito tabs enhance security.</p>
      <p><strong>Browsers</strong><br>The supported browsers are Chromeâ„¢, Edgeâ„¢, Operaâ„¢, and Safariâ„¢. Trademarks are properties of their respective owners.</p>
