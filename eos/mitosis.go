// Problem. We need a distributed scaling logic that is
// fail proof for quantum grade security.
// i.e. no single point or hot spot of failure in the age of quantum computers
// Solution.
// Each machine has an expected runtime, after which it terminates normally.
// Do a mitosis check at 25%, 50%, and 75% of expected runtime.
// If load is at least 25%, 50% and 75% at these points, we create a new node.
// We terminate the node at 100% not issuing new sessions after 75%.
// We do not terminate on the system that is marked as root, as a long haul test.

// Discussion.
// An automated termination logic helps to resolve sporadic issues and data leaking.
// Mitosis checks can help to address quick demand increases.
// An automated termination also handles automated scaling down.
// The logic is nice as it needs only local demand knowledge to scale the cluster up and down.
// We need a random load balancer to achieve this for the session starts.
// Problem. Kubernetes already does this.
// Solution. Yes, but it uses millions of lines of code. This is easier to learn as a starter before moving on.
// It is easier to security review, if it is shorter.
// Trick: it saves time and money for security reviewers who work for a fixed fee vs. feature count based fee.

// Mitosis checks and executes a scaling logic inspired by millions of years of evolution.
// It is similar to how amoebas and bacteria are splitting getting enough nutrients.
// Setup. Here is the basic calculation to set the two parameters.
// A single 1 VCPU node is capable of handling 1000 MBps.
// Assume we handle sessions that require 10 MBps dedicated lines.
// We also assume that sessions last max 2 hours on the line,
// and we have to reserve for the entire session.
// We limit launches for at most eight hours to avoid any garbage piling up.
// We assume a utility ratio of 50%.
// Such a container can handle a load of
// 8 hrs / 2 hrs * 1000 MBps / 10 MBps * 50% = 200 sessions of the entire 8+2 hrs lifetime.
// That allows 1000 MBps / 10 MBps * 50% = 50 concurrent sessions.
//
// The final logic then is the following.
// If we have not passed 2 hrs, when 50 sessions have been launched, we carry out mitosis.
// If we have not passed 4 hrs, when 100 sessions have been launched, we carry out mitosis.
// If we have not passed 6 hrs, when 150 sessions have been launched, we carry out mitosis.
// If we have not passed 8 hrs, when 200 sessions have been launched, we carry out mitosis.
// We carry out an outstanding mitosis at 8 hours to a followup node.
// We forward all local launches to the followup node after 8 hours.
// We terminate the current instance at 10 hours, since all session reservations expired.
// We terminate the current instance at max sessions, since the state is statistically dirty/exhausted.
