// Some may say to run the launcher in a non-privileged container and have a separate container that handles docker.
// Our approach is to make the :443 listener get bundled with privileged docker runners.
// Running the docker stuff separately would also require opening a socket or pipe that may be tampered with by other containers.
// However, we must ensure that it remains simple, and it is easy to review.
// This is what this test does.
